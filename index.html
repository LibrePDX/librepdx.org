    LibrePDX is a community with the common belief that great things are
    achieved through cooperation, accessibility and a strong supporting
    foundation. We believe that the open-source movement embodies these
    characteristics and helps strengthen some of the most positive qualities
    of a functioning society.

  <p>
    Let us illuminate our journey so others may <em>discover us</em>.
    Let us share our stories so that we may inspire and energize others to <em>join us</em>.
    Let us <em>grow together</em>, <em>learn together</em> and <em>build upon each other</em>.
    Let us become more than the sum of our parts and have fun along the way!

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <em>Document Portland's history</em> as it relates to the open-source
      community. Right now most of our history is scattered or undocumented.
      Let us work to collect and preserve this!
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Identify and build a graph</em> of projects, companies and people
      involved in open-source related areas in the greater Portland area.
      <a href="http://epdx.org/">ePDX</a> has made a great start at building
      a wiki of connections within the tech community. Let us build on this
      and quantify the wealth we create!
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Share our successes and challenges</em> through community contributed
      articles. Most successes go unnoticed by people outside of the immediate
      community and mainstream media has a difficult time picking up what's
      newsworthy. Let us make it easy for everyone to learn about us!
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Encourage and seed cross-pollination</em> opportunities between the
      different sub-communities and beyond. Let us ensure that the tech, arts,
      music, education, government, finance and other communities know what
      we're each doing and how to effectively collaborate with each other!
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Make it easy to get involved</em> by reducing barriers and
      increasing opportunities for people to learn and find mentors. Let us
      make sure open-source is synonymous with having a great time!
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Work towards a more sustainable society</em> that is actively
      engaged in making our world a more enjoyable place to live. Let us
      work to reduce structural violence and create more opportunities for
      people to pursue the things they're passionate about!
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <em>Open-source is about software, right?</em><br />
      No. While much of the open-source movement's history is centered around
      software, it can be generalized around the idea of giving back in a
      way that others can take and further build upon. Open-source can also
      be about the process as much as the product, working toward our goals
      in an open, transparent and inviting way that encourages participation.

      <em>I've heard of the copyleft, and I'm strongly for/against it!</em><br />
      While some members might feel strongly about copyleft licensing, the
      mission of the group is to promote a healthy community and culture that
      is encouraged to work together to grow and build upon the steps of others.

      <em>How do you differ from Stumptown Syndicate and their mission?</em><br />
        Some overlap of mission exists with <a href="http://stumptownsyndicate.org/">Stumptown Syndicate</a>
        and the hope is that the two groups will leverage each others' strengths.
        The two groups differ in structure and mechanics for participation;
        this enables different forms of involvement and participation.
      <p>
        Stumptown Syndicate is a non-profit legal entity with a board of
        directors. At the moment, their efforts are mostly focused around
        bringing people together through events, ensuring groups have necessary
        resources to function and increasing education and diversity within
        the tech community.
      </p>
      <p>
        LibrePDX is a flat, non-legal do-ocracy focused around increasing
        visibility and connectedness of all things relating to the
        open-source model of development and community building. If you have
        a idea, share it! If you can do something, do it! If someone has your
        idea, join them! You can't fail if you volunteer, you can only learn.
